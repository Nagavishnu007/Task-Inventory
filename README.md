I used React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS to build a Dynamic Inventory Management Table App. In this app, users can add products along with their category, quantity, and price.

Users can also modify products as needed.

The app includes a feature to filter products by category.

Additionally, if the quantity of a product is less than 10, the background of that particular item is highlighted in red.

The app is fully responsive and user-friendly.
